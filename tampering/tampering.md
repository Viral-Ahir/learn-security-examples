# Tampering

This example demonstrates tampering through script injection.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Install all dependencies

   `npm install`

2. Start the **insecure.ts** server

   `npx ts-node insecure.ts`

3. In the browser, type a potentially malicious script in the name field of the form

   ```
       <script> document.body.innerHTML = "<a href='https://google.com'> Gotcha </a>"</script>
   ```

4. Do you see the potentially malicious hyperlink being injected into the form?

## For you to do

Answer the following:

1. Briefly explain the potential vulnerabilities in **insecure.ts**
   ANSWER -
   insecure.ts is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to unsanitized user input. Malicious scripts submitted in the "name" field are directly used, allowing attacks like data theft or manipulation.
2. Briefly explain how a malicious attacker can exploit them.
   ANSWER -
   An attacker can inject a script in the "name" field. If the input isnâ€™t sanitized, the script runs when the page loads, enabling actions like stealing cookies or redirecting users to harmful sites.
3. Briefly explain why **secure.ts** does not have the same vulnerabilties?
   ANSWER -
   secure.ts prevents XSS by sanitizing user inputs, ensuring any malicious scripts are neutralized before execution, protecting the app from harmful code injections.
